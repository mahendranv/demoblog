# Getting started with Hasura cloud

### What is Hasura?

Hasura cloud is a GraphQL engine provider for your data source. 

For this example, I'll connect my postgres db hosted in heroku with the cloud.

### Getting started

To start with the cloud, go to https://cloud.hasura.io/ and create an account. It is free for dev usage.

Once account created by verifying the email, you'll land in dashboard â€”> Projects.

Go ahead, and click on New project. It might ask you to select Free / Standard tier. I'm selecting Free. Now you should see a new new project created (even named?!) for you.

I like the part where they took away the painful part of coming up with a name for the project. With few clicks, I already have a working graphQL engine to consume. But the source??



Launch the project console and ***onwards***.

### Connecting data source

Once the project console launched, you will land in API explorer. Without a data source, we don't have much to do here. Head over to the **Data** tab, where we create/connect the data source.

Click - **Connect Database** and switch to Heroku tab

Now click on **Create Database**, if you have logged into Heroku - the session would connect. Otherwise signup for a free heroku account and authorise to connect Hasura.

You should see a nice animation and a database created and connected with your project.
